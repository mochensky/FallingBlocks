# [Falling Blocks](https://modrinth.com/project/8Y2Nz1vf)

**Falling Blocks** turns your world into a collapsing danger zone! At random intervals, blocks around every player lose stability and fall as physics-affected entities. Build quickly, stay alert - the ground might not be there for long. **Yes, you can still beat the game!**

## Features

- **Random Collapse Events**: Every 30-120 seconds, a sphere around each player triggers falling blocks.
- **Countdown Warning**: A global boss bar appears 5 seconds before the collapse begins.
- **Smart Physics**: Most solid blocks can fall - exceptions include bedrock, portal blocks, fluids, etc.
- **Vanilla-Friendly**: Works seamlessly with vanilla Minecraft and most other mods.
- **Server-Side**: Only the server (or the player hosting the world) needs the mod installed-perfect for multiplayer chaos!

## Why Play?
This mod adds tension and unpredictability to your survival experience. Whether you're seeking a unique challenge or want to spice up multiplayer worlds, **Falling Blocks** keeps you constantly moving and adapting. Can you survive when the world keeps falling apart?
